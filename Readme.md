## 🌟 Features

- We propose a new dataset, FGDD, for facial phenotype analysis of rare genetic diseases, which can be used not only for training explainable diagnostic models but also for in-depth analysis of the complex gene-disease-facial phenotype relationships and for mining more potential associations and patterns. 
- We have conducted extensive benchmarking on our dataset, and commonly used machine learning models can achieve up to 81% accuracy and provide clinical support. 
- We conducted an explainability analysis from both local and global perspectives, and the models trained on FGDD can provide explainable predictions that can be corroborated by relevant research, and enhance physicians’ confidence in the model results, which is particularly important in the medical field.
